## Variable

- Words in curly brackets are variables. Example: {variable}.
- Variables MAY be highlighted as inline code.
  - Format:

    ~~~md
    `{variable}`
    ~~~

  - Example: `{variable}`.
- A variable in curly brackets is replaced with its value.
  
  - Example:
    - The value of {variable} is 4.
    - Then,

      ~~~md
      - {{variable}} equals 42.
      - `{{variable}}` equals `42`.
      - ``{{variable}}`` equals ``42``.
      ~~~

- The `{X}`, `{Y}`, `{Z}` variables are numbers that:
  - correspond to team numbers;
  - can take values `12`, `34`, `56`;
  - are pairwise different.

- The `{S}` variable is a number that denotes the index of the current sprint.
  
  Sprint indices are given [here](https://github.com/team-work-tools/team-work-telegram-bot/issues/79).
